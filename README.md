# dForce
dForce is a scientific tool designed to simulate dynamic AFM experiments. The code has been developed at the forcetool group (http://tinyurl.com/havg3) where version 0.0 can be found. We have also publish a paper which can help you to set up your first dynamic AFM simulations and understand the mathematical model underneath dForce (http://tinyurl.com/havg-pub3). Note: The simulator will speed up experimental data interpretation, facilitate the planning of new experiments and, in the process, will advance force microscopy. However, dForce simulations could not be considered a substitute for the rational understanding of dynamic AFM. That knowledge will be gained and optimized by combining the reading of the proper scientific literature with dForce simulations.
